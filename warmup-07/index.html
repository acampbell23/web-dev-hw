    <h2 class="title">The Origin of Species (1859)</h2>

    <div class=text" >
      <p> When on board H.M.S. ‘Beagle,’ as naturalist,
         I was much struck with certain facts in the distribution
        of the organic beings inhabiting South America, and
        in the geological relations of the present to the past
        inhabitants of that continent. These facts, as will
        be seen in the latter chapters of this volume,
        seemed to throw some light on the origin of
        species—that mystery of mysteries, as it has
        been called by one of our greatest philosophers. </p>

        <p>My work is now (1859) nearly finished; but as it
        will take me many more years to complete it, and
        as my health is far from strong, I have been urged
        to publish this Abstract. I have more especially
        been induced to do this, as Mr. Wallace, who is
        now studying the natural history of the Malay
        archipelago, has arrived at almost exactly the
        same general conclusions that I have on the
        origin of species. In 1858 he sent me a memoir on
        this subject, with a request that I would forward
        it to Sir Charles Lyell, who sent it to the Linnean
        Society, and it is published in the third volume of
        the Journal of that Society. Sir C. Lyell and Dr.
      Hooker, who both knew of my work—the latter having
      read my sketch of 1844—honoured me by thinking it
      advisable to publish, with Mr. Wallace’s excellent
      memoir, some brief extracts from my manuscripts.</p>
